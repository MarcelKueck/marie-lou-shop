## Recommended Generation Order

1. **Start with Prompt 1** (Hero Shot) — establish the core product look
2. **Then Prompt 5** (Product Lineup) — show size variants
3. **Then Prompt 9 or 10** (Lifestyle) — show context
4. **Then Prompt 3** (Detail Shot) — highlight craftsmanship
5. **Finally Prompt 4** (LED Glow) — showcase smart features

Use consistent seed values (if available) to maintain design consistency across generations.

*Tip: Generate multiple variations and iterate. Use the best result as an image reference for subsequent generations to maintain consistency.*
