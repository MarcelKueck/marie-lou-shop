      "p2": "Every afternoon, without exception, she invited someone over for coffee. A neighbor. A friend. Sometimes a stranger who just needed someone to talk to. Her kitchen table was where people came to feel welcome, to feel heard, to feel loved.",
      "p3": "As a small child, I was given an important job: brewing the coffee. I'd carefully measure the grounds into her old French press, pour the hot water, and wait — watching the dark liquid slowly steep. Those afternoons taught me something that would shape my entire life."

      "p2": "We met farmers who worked from sunrise to sunset, picking coffee cherries by hand in the heat. Families living in conditions we couldn't have imagined. Children whose futures were largely determined by where they happened to be born.",
      "p3": "We saw the disconnect: the coffee I was paying €15 for in Munich came from people earning a fraction of that price. The supply chain was designed to extract value at every step. I couldn't stop thinking: how is this okay?"
