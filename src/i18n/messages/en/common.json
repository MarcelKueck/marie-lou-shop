      "p3": "As a small child, I was given an important job: brewing the coffee. I'd carefully measure the grounds into her old French press, pour the hot water, and wait — watching the dark liquid slowly steep. Those afternoons taught me something that would shape my entire life."

      "p3": "We saw the disconnect: the coffee I was paying €15 for in Munich came from people earning a fraction of that price. The supply chain was designed to extract value at every step. I couldn't stop thinking: how is this okay?"
